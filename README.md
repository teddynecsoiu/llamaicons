# llamaicons v0.1
### General purpose free vector icons

llamaicons is a free vector icons set, building around a strong style guideline (but looser than Google's Material Icons) created by [Teddy Necsoiu](https://twitter.com/teddynecsoiu).


## Contributing

Contributions are very welcomed and quite encouraged. The basic idea behind the icon set is that one day it will become a giant repository of high quality icons, 4K ready and "pixel perfect", that any developer can use to create it's interface or graphics.

Inside the [Guides](https://github.com/teddynecsoiu/llamaicons/tree/master/guides) folder you can find the three grids upon witch any icon is build. A more detailed walk-through will be available soon detailing the complete guidelines and start-up steps. 

## Versioning

Currency, not all icons are uploaded, hence the 0.1 version. Once all the currently created icons are up, version shall move to 1.0.  Before that, I need to make sure that the icons abide by my own style guideline.
